# Local Services Backend

A backend API for a Local Services Booking System, developed with FastAPI and PostgreSQL. This project provides features for user and admin authentication, service provider management, service bookings, reviews, notifications, advanced search/filtering, and robust payment and provider wallet handling.

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for both users and admins.
- User registration, login, logout, password reset, and token refreshing.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with separate admin and user privileges.

### User Management
- Retrieve, update, and delete user profiles.
- Admins can manage user accounts (view and delete users).

### Service Provider Management
- List all service providers.
- Retrieve detailed profiles and reviews for each provider.
- Admins can add, update, or delete service providers.
- Users can submit ratings and reviews for providers.

### Booking System
- Authenticated users can create, view, update, and cancel bookings.
- Admin endpoints to list, approve, or reject any booking.
- Bookings are linked to both users and service providers.

### Reviews & Ratings
- Users can submit and view reviews for service providers.

### Search & Filters

## Payment & Wallet System

### Payment
- **Integrated with Razorpay** for secure, real-world payment processing.
- Payment model tracks status (`created`, `succeeded`, `failed`), amount, currency, and related booking.
- Endpoints for initiating payments, marking as successful, logging payments, and processing refunds.
- Payment verification and webhook handling via Razorpay.

### Provider Wallet
- Each service provider has a wallet account, automatically tracked and updated.
- Wallet tracks real-time balance, all earnings, withdrawals, and refunds as transactions.
- Automatic commission deduction and credit to provider wallet after successful bookings.
- Minimum withdrawal amount and balance checks enforced.

### Withdrawals
- Providers can request withdrawals to UPI.
- Withdrawal requests are tracked with statuses (`requested`, `approved`, `rejected`, `processed`, `failed`).
- Admins can approve/reject withdrawal requests.
- All wallet activity is transparently logged.
